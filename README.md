## Setup

1. `cargo build --release` to build `tidal-richpresence.exe`
2. Join https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1242553912322560122 (idk why it says it can send direct messages i never want to send direct messages.)
3. Copy the `tidal_richpresence_config.json` file and place it somewhere accessible.
4. Run `tidal_richpresence.exe` followed by the path for the config.
5. If TIDAL is currently playing music, pause it and wait for ~4 seconds, TIDAL should 
then be found by the executable and should start sending rich presence information to 
Discord.

### Running on startup

1. Do steps 1-3 from the section above
2. Create a shortcut for `tidal_richpresence.exe`, place this within the Windows 
Start-up folder
3. Edit the shortcuts target (Right click, Properties) to look something like this:
<PATH WHERE EXE LIVES> <PATH TO tidal_richpresence.exe>
4. It's probably good to also have Discord auto launch
